These key pairs were graciously provided by [Eric Betts](http://ericbetts.org). They do not conform to my existing [WEP key calculator](https://xkyle.com/2009/03/03/verizon-fios-wireless-key-calculator/).

Maybe Verizon wised up and made them random? The previous correlation was dead obvious, but this one I can't see.

Of course, I am only a wannabe cryptologist :)
