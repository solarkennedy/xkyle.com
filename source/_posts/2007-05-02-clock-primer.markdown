Here is the intro to the clock project:

[![Stencil](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0114.thumbnail.JPG)](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0114.JPG) We start with a template made at a sign shop, and the cover the edges with aluminum tape to protect them from the heat from the hot wire.

[![styro1](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0115.thumbnail.JPG)](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0115.JPG) I've pushed out holes with a strait wire and a blow torch to give my entry points for my hot wires. Its going to be a plunge and cut job.

[![laser](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0117.thumbnail.JPG)](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0117.JPG) The laserpointer helps guide the hot wire because it inevitably bends and makes crooked cuts. Following the point makes straiter cuts. The laser isn't cutting the stryofoam for us... Yet.

[![cut](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0118a.thumbnail.JPG)](https://xkyle.com/wp-content/uploads/dcam0118a.JPG) Only a CNC machine could have done a better job. A CNC machine.... With a laser cutter!!!
