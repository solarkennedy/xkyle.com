This past Tuesday I hosted a DNS training seminar for all the employees at Sago. It went over great! The curriculum involved:



	
  * The difference between Caching and Authoritative DNS

	
  * All the different types of DNS Records

	
  * How to use dig and how to interpret it

	
  * How to troubleshoot dns problems

	
  * Secret DNS Tricks!


I recorded the [AUDIO](https://xkyle.com/other/dns.mp3) (sorry the audio sucks) and the [BASH history](https://xkyle.com/other/dns-history.txt) for those poor souls who want to listen to me drone on for an hour about dns.... :)
