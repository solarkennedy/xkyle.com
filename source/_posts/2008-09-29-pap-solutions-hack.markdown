My girlfirend likes to do these puzzles called [Pic-A-Pix](http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/pic-a-pix) from [ConceptisPuzzles](http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/).
They use a matrix of numbers to hint the puzzler to to filling in pixels to create pixel art. Sometimes there is color. Every week four new PAP's are pushed out, and I've been told that the answers are somewhere on the website.... but that would be cheating. :)

So I wrote my own program to decode these and make images using html tables. I have it in my crontab.weekly and I have it set to email them to my girlfriend to annoy her.

Here is the link:
