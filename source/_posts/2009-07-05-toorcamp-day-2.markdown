After this second day of talks and no missle silo, there was this strange influx of women as the sunset approached. Turns out they were not for the camp, they were for the band:

They thought it was cool I guess. Somehow the owner of the silo booked these two events to have them intersect. Why else would 3 bands play in the middle of nowhere?

Afterwards there was free beer, and let me tell you, geeks can party hardy all night long:

That is two people with EL wires suits and a pirate's mast camp. Below is a zip of all the movies and pictures I collected from this day:
