I've finally moved to Colorado, and I had to leave the big clock behind, and luckily I had finished it:

I finilized the code, installed the clock in my [church](http://relevantchurch.com), and programmed it for there needs. The code is stored [here](https://dev.xkyle.com/clock/) if someone want to see it. If you want to check it out run:


> svn co https://dev.xkyle.com/clock


I have a little more technical info on my [wiki](http://wiki.xkyle.com/Clock), but it basically goes like this:

So using this and Openvpn, I can control the clock through the serial interface anywhere in the world, even Colorado! And of course the best part of it all, the church staff can also control it by sending an [@reply using twitter!](http://twitter.com/relevantclock)
