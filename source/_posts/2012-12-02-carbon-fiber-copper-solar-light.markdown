A copper tube sculptural with carbon fiber leaves. One of the carbon fiber leaves is a solar panel from a deconstructed solar lamp. The tips of the small copper tubes have the white LEDs. The larger copper tube stores the battery and charge circuitry. I would show pictures of them at night but the sun doesn't shine much here anymore...
