You may not know, but I used to work for Wikipedia! ([here if you don't believe me](http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Staff&direction=next&oldid=19464))

You also may not know that all Wikimedia Foundation projects (like Wikipedia) run off of a opensource piece of software called [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

The software is the bomb, and I've had my own for a number of years to keep track of my own project documentation (like a notebook.) But I've never made it public. Well....

My good friend [Pete](http://www.timelordz.com/blog/) has [his](http://www.timelordz.com/wiki/) public, so I've decied to make mine public too, for the sake of competition of course :)

Mine is more personal, for my own projects, his more more like a Linux/General knowledgebase.
