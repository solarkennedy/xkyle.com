I was thinking about moving my Wii, and relocating it to a more conspicuous place. I was annoyed at my sensor bar getting in the way:

I knew that the sensor bar was just 2 IR LEDs. So why not just build those LEDs right into the TV? One less cord to lay around. Lets open it up!

I used the given board that had 2 White LEDs that lit up the Westinghouse Logo. I simply added my own IR leds and some wires:

Drill some holes and stick them in! Then put everything back in its place:

Works great! More powerful than the stock sensor bar LEDs, so they respond better with my TV next to the window:

Of course, our eyes cannot see the infrared, so the TV looks the same!
