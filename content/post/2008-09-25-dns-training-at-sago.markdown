This past Tuesday I hosted a DNS training seminar for all the employees at Sago. It went over great! The curriculum involved:

  * The difference between Caching and Authoritative DNS
  * All the different types of DNS Records
  * How to use dig and how to interpret it
  * How to troubleshoot dns problems
  * Secret DNS Tricks!

I recorded the [AUDIO](/other/dns.mp3) (sorry the audio sucks) and the [BASH history](/other/dns-history.txt) for those poor souls who want to listen to me drone on for an hour about dns.... :)
