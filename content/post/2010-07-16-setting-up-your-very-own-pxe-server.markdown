Ever fumbled around your house looking for a Linux CD,  but you can't find it? Ever suspected that your ram was going bad, but  you didn't have a way to test it? Ever needed to backup files on a  computer that had a dead and broken operating system? A solution to all  these problems is a super cool tool called PXE booting. PXE booting  allows you to load alternative operating systems over the network,  without the need for cds, cdroms, etc!

Sound like something that you could benefit from? Setting up your  own PXE boot environment is easy and Fun! Check out my [presentation](http://wiki.xkyle.com/File:Pxe.pdf) and then later my [wiki  page](http://wiki.xkyle.com/pxe) for notes, commands, and configuration snippets to get your own  setup going.
