title: Etherhouse Part 1 - Hardware
---

Etherhouse a project of mine involving eight Christmas gifts. Each gift
involved a display of some model houses made from folded paper, each
representing the home of a friend or family member.

The houses light up, depending on whether that family member is home or not.
Their presence is detected based on if their smartphone is on the same network
the etherhouse is on.

See the [GitHub](https://github.com/solarkennedy/ether_house#hardware) page
for more details.
