I was talking with my girlfriend recently, and I told her that her "RA Class" (RA is short for [resident assistant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_assistant), someone who lives on campus to assist other residents) is a "Boom Boom" class. She is from [Niceville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niceville) and had never heard of the term. I knew it as a slang term for a low level class that required no effort, taken simply for credit.

In an effort to locate some sort of source for my definition besides anecdotes of the people I knew, I was only able to find other personal references (myspace, facebook) coincidentally from people in Tampa. Turns out that this term appears to originate specifically from Tampa!

Here is my evidence:

	
  1. [Urban Dictionary ](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boom%20boom)Claiming this fact[
](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boom%20boom)
	
  2. [Google Results ](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&hs=HQd&q=%22boom+boom+class%22+site%3Amyspace.com&btnG=Search)only turning up myspace pages in Tampa and Arizona?
	
  3. [More Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&hs=kmI&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=%22boom+boom+class%22+forum&spell=1) on forum hits, again only Tampa and Arizona specific things
	
  4. [Nothing on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Boom_(disambiguation))
	
  5. That is all I have. Its mostly anecdotal.
