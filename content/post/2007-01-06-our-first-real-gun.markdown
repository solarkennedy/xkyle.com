Here it is, the big milestone: our first real gun!

From this:

To [this!](/video/gun.mov)

You can see how we have gutted an air-soft gun, and inserted our led's and switches to turn it into a lasertag gun. All of our guns will be interchangeable as they will all have the same Cat-5 Pinout. Eventually we will have an array of guns and we can change their properties in software. (Reload times, shots per clip, damage per shot, etc..)
