I'm changing my name from "Kyle Anderson" to Kyle Cascade".
I'm changing it in anticipation of a new family member, and my wife and I figured it would be nice to all have the same last name together, without patriarchal traditions.
And it sounds cool.

But seriously, it marks a new chapter in my life.
We wanted to pick a new name that represented us.
We wanted a nod to nature, but also nothing too far out there.
We also didn't want to "steal" someone else's last name, so we didn't want to select a name that was already in wide use.
"Cascade" fit the bill nicely.

Isn't it great that we live (at least in the US) in a society where one can _choose_ their own name (and other traits)?
We exist first, sure, but then our [essence comes second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_precedes_essence).
Wouldn't it be neat if we had a tradition of people picking their own name (first and/or last) for themselves, as a rite of passage into adulthood?
One's identity is not determined at birth, and your parent's last name doesn't define you, it's just a reminder of where you came from.

Also, the name change also means an excuse to buy a new domain name :).
