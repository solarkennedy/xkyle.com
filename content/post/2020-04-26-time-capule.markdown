I've held onto this Time Capsule for 29 years. I believe I made it in first grade, at seven years old, at [Cypress Woods Elementary](https://www.pcsb.org/Domain/23) in "Gifted Class".

Certainly some things have fallen out of the manila folders. The things that I drew are a kind of snapshot of my life at the time?

* Bart Simpson
* Bill - Bill Clinton?
* Self-Portrait
* Nintendo - NES
* Orbiter - The Space Shuttle Orbiter
* Wcheis (sic) - Watches? I do remember really liking my digital watch
