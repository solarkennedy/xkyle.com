I suppose I come from a... short line of engineers. My father used to work for [Paradyne](http://www.paradyne.com/) which was gobbled up by At&t, and is now owned by [Zhone](http://www.zhone.com/).

But back in the day they worked on "[Terminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal)". You know, back when "Computers" has a gazillion serial ports and the "Terminal" was the box that had a monitor and keyboard which parsed the 300baud green text? Yea neither do I...

But I've read about such times, and I know about the history of my [xterm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm) and [picocom](http://efault.net/npat/hacks/picocom/) programs. They emulate these devices. Such devices that my Dad (Richard Anderson) designed! It is good to know your roots. Amazing:
