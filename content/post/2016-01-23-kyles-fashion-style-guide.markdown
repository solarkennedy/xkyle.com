I recently read ["Why Are SO Many Millennials SO Uncool?"](http://powerevolution.tumblr.com/post/133543612986/why-are-so-many-millennials-so-uncool).
Let's start with a quote:

> *For the purpose of this writing, I’m defining “cool” as those who don’t
> conform, who don’t always fit in nor do they try to, and who follow their own
> path; and “uncool” as those who dress, act, and have the same tastes as the
> masses and are vulnerable to corporate influences.

Now, I'm by no means some sort of authority on *coolness*. By this definition
there is certainly some degree of subjectivity, but this definition has a hint
of personal-values embedded into it.

In otherwords, this is more than "I don't like black socks and sandles", but
more like "I value non-corporate-sellouts." At least this value extends beyond
*just* personal taste.

## Individuality Versus Popularity

Anyone can choose to adopt this value. I can appreciate it.

If fully adopted, it seems like this would encompass normal corporate branding
stuff, as well as things that are simply "popular". By this definition, wearing
a popular brand name or adopting a trendy style is "uncool". This is at odds
with the definition of "cool" that I learned in middle-school. In fact, in
middle-school the definition of cool was the exact **opposite** of the author's
definition.

This is fine. As we mature into adults, some people outgrow this definition of
coolness. Others do not.

| Corporate Gucci Bag: Uncool           | Handmade Etsy Bag: Cool |


I can get behind this. I also individuality over popularity. I also dislike
corporate influences. (or heck, external influences in general)

## Examining My (Tech) Wardrobe 

One of my other personal values is *consistency*. If I'm going to adopt this
value and be consistent, then perhaps I should examine my wardrobe...

What external corporate ends am I promoting with my wardrobe? Well let's start
with all these technology tshirts:


| ![Docker Shirt](../uploads/docker_shirt.jpg) | ![OpenSSL Shirt](../uploads/openssl_shirt.jpg) |
| --- | --- |
| Docker Shirt: Uncool | OpenSSL Shirt: Cool |

Both Docker and OpenSSL are open source, but wearing a Docker shirt implicitly
promotes the *Docker Company*. On the other hand, OpenSSL is goverend by the
OpenSSL Software Foundation. Is wearing a Docker shirt on par with showing
off your Gucci bag?

| ![Ubuntu Shirt](../uploads/ubuntu_shirt.jpg) | ![Debian Shirt](../uploads/debian_shirt.jpg) |
| --- | --- |
| Ubuntu Shirt: Uncool | Debian Shirt: Cool |

Ubuntu is a product of *Canonical*. Debian doesn't have any corporate
counterpart.  Is wearing an Ubuntu shirt uncool because you are providing free
advertising for a corporate entity?

| ![AWS Shirt](../uploads/aws_shirt.jpg) | ![Openstack Shirt](../uploads/openstack_shirt.jpg) |
| --- | --- |
| AWS Shirt: Uncool | Openstack Shirt: Uncool too |

I don't know man, I don't think Openstack shirts are cool either....

## Non-tech

These above examples are given mostly because the represent a large portion
of my wardrobe. In general the same principle of rejecting corporate sponsors
carries over to non-tech shirts.

I dare say that even wearing shirts with logos of your current or previous
employers are **not** cool.

## Conclusion

In general, wearing something that promotes another company's products, I guess
is uncool, even if you like the product or even contribute to it. The root cause
is that you are allowing yourself to be treated as a means to their promotion?

Of course the act of trying to be cool in uncool in itself, so I'm pretty sure
I'm forever destined to remain... uncool.
