Recently I gave a presentation on [Plug Computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_computer) at the local [NCLUG](http://nclug.org/).Â  Plug computers are inexpensive, small, and low power computers, about the size of a wall wart.

They make great home servers, appropriate for file sharing, exporting media files for your devices ([DLNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance)), making backups ([backuppc](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/)), etc.
