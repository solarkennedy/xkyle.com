title: Build Versus Buy and Personal Engineering Capital
---

Fully understanding the **build-versus-buy** trade-off requires a bunch of
different context to really get right. At first glance you might think that
you only need to really understand:

* The problem you are trying to solve
* How the thing you are looking to buy solves the problem

But in reality it is much more nuanced than that. Most of the reading out there
about the build-versus-buy trade-off is written with "enterprise" software in
mind, and evaluate things on a very first-order level. Concerns like:

* How well can this software integrate with other things?
* How much does this software cost?
* How much time will it take to integrate the software and make it meet your
  organizations' needs?

These are all important questions to ask, but there are higher-order concerns
that take some time to fully appreciate like:

* In the long run, can your developers build a solution that provides more
  long-term value to your organization? (even if in the short-term it costs
more and takes longer to build?)
* How will your (in-house or external) users "feel" when they notice that your
  solution is based on an off-the-shelf (bought) product?
* Can you account for the in-house skills and expertise that would be
  simultaneously developed (and required) if the solution was developed
in-house?
* Will there be any developer or user attrition if you built versus if you bought?

These are not as easy to answer, but the answers to them may be even more
significant than the $$$ figures your vendor may come up with.

I've never been really satisfied with the "build-versus-buy" trade-off in
general, mostly because throughout my entire career, it has never been a
dichotomy: I was always building, and always buying.

### Understanding the False Dichotomy

The false-dichotomy comes from the fact that everything "bought" requires
integration, and it is that *building* that integration that actually builds
the value to your organization.

At the same time, we are always building. Even when it seems like we are
choosing the "Build" option, are are still buying, it just the we are buying
libraries, frameworks, and other components to build the solution. Things are
not built in a vacuum.

It is all building, and all buying. There is no such thing as a turn-key
solution, it is just a spectrum between simpler and more complex products.

It is in the building that you provide value to your organization and to your
users. It is in the buying that you "stand on the shoulders of giants" and
become a more powerful engineer by building on top of existing engineering.

### "Core Competency": The Ultimate Faux Trump-Card

Sometimes it is "simple" to describe some build-versus-buy decisions by framing
them in terms of what the organizations' "core competency" is. Sometimes it is
so simple as "if it is within our core competency, then we build, otherwise we
buy".

What does "core competency" really mean? Before software was [eating the
world](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460),
"core competency" could have meant something very different. But now software
is seen as a universal multiplier for every business, regardless of what they
do. What does software have to do with [Nike's](https://engineering.nike.com/)
core competency? [TBD]

### Case Study: Game Design

Game design, like any other software engineering pursuit, also involves many
build-versus-buy decisions. From assets, to engines, to voice acting, to motion
capture, there are many many micro build-versus-buy decisions to make when
developing a game. In some sense, *every one* of these decisions fits into
their "core competency". In another sense, building your own game engine for
example, sounds like a decision that 90% of game studios should choose "buy"
over build. Is developing your own game engine in-house part [TBD]
