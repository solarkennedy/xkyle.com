My friends and I are currently constructing our own lasertag guns using [this](http://www.lasertagparts.com) as a base.

Here is our checklist:



	
  * Construct electronic components using the above milestag components.

	
  * Get and modify vests to hold components

	
  * Melt aluminum and pour guns into molds! Rock on!

	
  * Connect it all together and play!


We've go the electronics together. The vests are on their way via UPS, and my friend Karl and I have the furnace ready and we can melt aluminum! We still need to put sensors on the vests, pour the guns, and interface it all together. But man, what an adventure!
