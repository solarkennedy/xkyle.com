The weekend I Kayaked to Anclote Key. Here is a picture of us unloading our Kayaks! (Not me in the picture)

We Kayaked 4 hours to the north end of Anclote Key. Here the the google [maps link](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.187778,-82.845556&spn=0.3,0.3&t=h&q=28.187778,-82.845556).

We camped overnight on the night of Valentines day. How romantic right?
