We have finally built enough pieces of the clock together to get some digits!
It basically comes down to a white wooden box, a piece of cardboard with the LEDs wired, running to a RJ45 jack. Then a stryofoam cutout painted black, with a white piece of paper and plexyglass on top for a face.

Here is the template with wired LEDS:

A multitude of completed digits (still missing the blank faceplate).

And the outputs of the controller: (Just cat5 connectors, cheap!)
