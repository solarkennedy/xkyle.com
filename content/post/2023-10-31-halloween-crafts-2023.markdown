Here is a sampling of craft projects for Halloween 2023 that I made with wife help.

Sorry for the terrible image quality.

### Transmutation Circle

Materials:
* Charcoal chalk
* LED Candles
* Magnet Wire
* Wemos D1 controller running [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/)
* Straight edge, vinyl stencils, wire/compass.

It is kinda surreal to see this in real life.
This thing is big enough to create a human from raw elements!
I'm hoping this is real enough to scare adults.

The candles add a lot to the effect.
Using magnet wire and the controller means I can remote-control them and not worry about batteries.

### LED Leaf Wreath

Materials:
* Wreath frame
* Tree trimmings
* RGB LED Strip
* Wemos D1 controller
* Flat speaker wire

This wreath is made out of trimmings from the tree outside.
The inner loop has a string of LED lights that I can tune for different occasions.
I used very flat white speaker wire (very hard to see) to power the thing.

I think every door deserves a wreath.

### Undersea Jack-O-Lantern

Materials:
* Pumpkin
* White LED Strips
* Parchment paper diffuser

I used Dall-E to create a image.
The exact prompt I used was "20000 leagues under the sea scene in stencil form".

In the end I only used the resulting image as inspiration to make my own undersea-scape using standard pumpkin carving tools.

I wouldn't say this pumpkin was my best work.

### Set (Game) Costume

Materials:
* [Scrap](https://www.scrap-sf.org/) corrugated sign board from COVID-19 posters
* Vinyl
* (Banana for scale)

My wife's math department is doing coordinated Halloween costumes this year: [Set Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

While I'm sure other teachers will have fabric paint and printer paper taped to shirts, my wife will have larger-than-life hyper-realistic replicas of her assigned card.

My goal is to get a cease and desist.

### Trick-Or-Treat Sign

[![trick-or-treat-sign.jpg text](/uploads/2023-10-31-halloween-crafts-2023/trick-or-treat-sign.thumb.jpg)](/uploads/2023-10-31-halloween-crafts-2023/trick-or-treat-sign.jpg)

Materials:
* Pallet wood
* [EL Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescent_wire)
* Permanent Marker
* Vinyl stencil

Just permanent marker on wood is surprisingly effective when used with a vinyl stencil. All my vinyl cutting is done with an original [Silhouette Portrait](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/portrait).

Just trying to make it as obvious as possible that our house is ready for trick-or-treaters. 

Hopefully the Transmutation circle and [noise](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/evilCharmRPGSoundscapeGenerator.php) isn't too scary!
