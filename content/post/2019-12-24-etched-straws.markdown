title: "Etched Team Straws"
---

I recently etched reusable metal straws for my team at work.

I used a [low-tech](https://hackaday.com/2015/01/15/etching-steel-with-a-dc-wall-wort/) procedure to etch the metal using electricity after applying a vinyl mask made with a hobby vinyl cutter.

The glass straws used food-safe ceramic paint baked in an oven, also using the same vinyl stencil.

The results are great. Click on any of the images below for a larger version. The last few are videos.
