I recently finished my MegaDesk project.
Here are the specs:

* 11 feet wide x 39 inches deep finished butcher block top
* leg-less design with lots of wood infrastructure underneath to support it
  * Supports that are anchored to the 2x6 studs
  * Horizontal support anchored to studs
* More outlets (there was only 1 lone outlet in this office originally)
* Cat6 and Coax in keystone jacks
* Cable pass-through tubes for clean cable management
* Insulation!
* 5/8" thick sound dampening drywall
* Cool triangular floating shelves (maybe I'll put some plants on them)
* Wall-mounted ultrawide monitor ([Samsung CGR9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/))
* Cables for future LEDs / speakers on the shelves
