Today I created some art:

{{< figure link="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art1.jpg" src="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art1.jpg" alt="Single Jellyfish" >}}
{{< figure link="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art2.jpg" src="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art2.jpg" alt="Two Jellyfish" >}}
{{< figure link="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art3.jpg" src="/uploads/jellyfish-art/art3.jpg" alt="All Five Jellyfish" >}}

They are made of black construction paper cut with a hobby craft cutter, mounted in floating frames.
