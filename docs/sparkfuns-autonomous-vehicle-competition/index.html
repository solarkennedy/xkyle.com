<p>Here is what the starting / finishing line looked like:</p>

<p>I was very impressed by the UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). Most of them were able to complete the course in record time. Some were even able to land autonomosouly!</p>

<p><a href="../uploads/Robota-Landing.3gp">Robota-Landing</a> <a href="../uploads/DougWiebel-landing.3gp">DougWiebel-landing</a> <a href="../uploads/Robota-Launch.3gp">Robota-Launch</a></p>

<p>Sorry for the 3gp format, it is native to the Droid. I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with the outcome of a transcode from ffmpeg or gstreamer. If someone wants to transcode for me, I would be happy to re-upload.</p>

<p>I was unimpressed with the ground vehicles. Only a few were able to complete the course. (Just four turns around the Sparkfun building) Most couldn&rsquo;t make it past the first turn. Did they simply not test them? Was it the new environment? I wasn&rsquo;t able to tell.</p>

<p>For sparkfun, having a three-piece band to play during the heats was a big win! They certainly kept the audience entertained, and by the time the 3rd heat came around, every team had their very own made-up-silly-them-song. I suppose it would be the equivalent of the organ player at a baseball game, but on steroids.</p>

<p>I hope to enter and win the next years competition!</p>
