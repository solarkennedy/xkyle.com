  <p>You may not know, but I used to work for Wikipedia! (<a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Staff&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=19464">here if you don&rsquo;t believe me</a>)</p>
<p>You also may not know that all Wikimedia Foundation projects (like Wikipedia) run off of a opensource piece of software called <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki</a>.</p>
<p>The software is the bomb, and I&rsquo;ve had my own for a number of years to keep track of my own project documentation (like a notebook.) But I&rsquo;ve never made it public. Well&hellip;.</p>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://www.timelordz.com/blog/">Pete</a> has <a href="http://www.timelordz.com/wiki/">his</a> public, so I&rsquo;ve decied to make mine public too, for the sake of competition of course :)</p>
<p>Mine is more personal, for my own projects, his more more like a Linux/General knowledgebase.</p>

  <p>Most vpns&hellip; in fact&hellip; all of them, are based on a client/server model. This means that all vpn clients call home to one vpn server and connect. All traffic goes through that vpn server and then gets passed on to its original destination. But what if you could have the benefits of VPN, but be able to communicate directly to other VPN peers, so without the latency and bandwidth limitations?</p>
<p><a href="../../uploads/2.png"><img src="../../uploads/2.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>That is what <a href="http://www.ntop.org/n2n/">n2n</a> is. The supernodes are NOT servers. They merely function as a way to punch holes in firewalls. Once the firewalls are open, the edge servers (think of them as clients) can talk directly with other edge clients. Cool!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried this, and so far the only draw back is the speed, it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as fast as you would think it would be. I can&rsquo;t find any other people complaining about it, but I&rsquo;ll look into it. But so far this is the simplest vpn I&rsquo;ve ever setup. Its a single command!</p>

  <p>Today is the Birthday of AloR, the author of the amazing tool, ettercap.</p>
<p><a href="../../uploads/etter-terminal.png"><img src="../../uploads/etter-terminal.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can see that because it is his birthday, he asks that you email him. I happily obliged.</p>
<p>Ettercap is an amazing tool. Not only does it have a console, curses, and graphical versions, it can be scripted, hacked, used with plugins, and the list goes on. Here is a screen shot of it in progress:</p>
<p><a href="../../uploads/ettercap.png"><img src="../../uploads/ettercap.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here is the everyday use senario:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find a network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scan for all hosts on that network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a man-in-the-middle attack and pose as the gateway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all your traffic belongs to us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load wireshark and profit!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But seriously, Ettercap has many tools and features to help you explore networks, for malicious or research purposes.</p>

  <p>My girlfirend likes to do these puzzles called <a href="http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/pic-a-pix">Pic-A-Pix</a> from <a href="http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/">ConceptisPuzzles</a>.
They use a matrix of numbers to hint the puzzler to to filling in pixels to create pixel art. Sometimes there is color. Every week four new PAP&rsquo;s are pushed out, and I&rsquo;ve been told that the answers are somewhere on the website&hellip;. but that would be cheating. :)</p>
<p>So I wrote my own program to decode these and make images using html tables. I have it in my crontab.weekly and I have it set to email them to my girlfriend to annoy her.</p>
<p>Here is the link:

<p>This past Tuesday I hosted a DNS training seminar for all the employees at Sago. It went over great! The curriculum involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between Caching and Authoritative DNS</li>
<li>All the different types of DNS Records</li>
<li>How to use dig and how to interpret it</li>
<li>How to troubleshoot dns problems</li>
<li>Secret DNS Tricks!</li>
</ul>
<p>I recorded the <a href="../../other/dns.mp3">AUDIO</a> (sorry the audio sucks) and the <a href="../../other/dns-history.txt">BASH history</a> for those poor souls who want to listen to me drone on for an hour about dns&hellip;. :)</p>

  <p>So I&rsquo;ve found a better way to do what I did in the previous post. Instead of running a separate script to parse the arp alert logs, I have arp alert itself send the alerts! The key is this line in the arpalert.conf</p>
<pre><code>action on detect = &quot;/etc/scripts/arp-alert&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Its so simple, it just runs that script sending the information about the alert as certain arguments. With this I have more control over the formatting of arpalert messages:</p>
<p><a href="../../uploads/screenshot2.png"><img src="../../uploads/screenshot2.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In order to do this, I had to write that script, and make it executable of course. Also I had to change the running user of arpalert to root, because the &ldquo;arpalert&rdquo; user didn&rsquo;t have permission to notify my user &ldquo;kyle&rdquo;. This is a much more clean solution, allowing me to make different types of alerts look different, having different timeouts and such. If you want my /etc/scripts/arp-alert you can download what I have so far <a href="../../other/arp-alert">here</a>.</p>

  <p>So I was looking around, and I wanted some sort of tool to allow me to be more aware about what was happening in the lower &ldquo;bowels&rdquo; of the network that I&rsquo;m on with my laptop. So what is it that I want&hellip;</p>
<p>What I really want is some sort of mac-address based buddy list. One that would show my a list of the mac addresses talking on my network, and allow me to alias them. That would be cool.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find such program, but I found something kinda close, its called arpalert. If you are using ubuntu you can simply run &ldquo;apt-get install arpalert&rdquo; (I love ubuntu!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kyle@kyle-laptop:~$ apt-cache search arpalert
arpalert - Monitor ARP changes in ethernet networks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should edit the config file to your liking, but the main thing is the log file in /var/log/arpalert.log. I have it logging every interesting arp thing, because I find them interesting! You need to read up on it if you want to fully understand arpalert: <a href="http://www.arpalert.org/">http://www.arpalert.org/</a></p>
<p>So that is the first part. The second part is the piece that notifies you of something suspicious. Who wants to tail a log file all the time? For this I use something called &ldquo;notify-send&rdquo;. Try running it. If you don&rsquo;t have it and you are running Ubuntu it will tell you that its part of the &quot;</p>

For this I use something called &ldquo;notify-send&rdquo;. Try running it. If you don&rsquo;t have it and you are running Ubuntu it will tell you that its part of the &ldquo;libnotify-bin&rdquo; package. So you will need to run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try it! run &ldquo;notify test&rdquo;. A popup should show up! Simple! Now, we need a small program to put the pieces together and glue it. I want my popup when odd things happen. Here is the glue I wrote, modify at will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tail -n 0  -F /var/log/arpalert.log | awk -W interactive &lsquo;{print $8, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12}&rsquo; |
while read heading message
do  notify-send -t 3000 &ndash; &ldquo;Arp Alert&rdquo; &ldquo;${heading} ${message}&rdquo;
done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m done with it yet. (I want to make it give different time outs for different types of messages, and I want it to change the heading to something dynamic instead of the Arp Alert, but yea) So put that in a .sh and run it! Nothing may pop up! Try putting something new on the network and seeing if something shows up in the log. Its pretty easy to troubleshoot and modify to your liking.</p>

  <p>Recently a DNS expert found a flaw in the way that DNS servers talk to other DNS servers to get records that allows interested parties (hackers) to insert their own records. If you need a primer: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning">Wikipedia link</a>.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; a DNS flaw is no fun without a tool to use it. So this guy &ldquo;HD Moore&rdquo; wrote a program (script) that takes advantage of this and makes it relatively easy for someone to use something called <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/framework/">Metasploit</a> to tinker with it. Cool!</p>
<p>Turns out that it works, and people are fixing their DNS servers so that this can&rsquo;t happen. (I fixed mine as soon as the fix was out.) But not everyone can fix their own, often they are at the mercy of their ISP&rsquo;s. (Have you ever called up your ISP&rsquo;s help desk and told them they need to upgrade their DNS servers to protect them against cache poisoning? Heheheh.. right)</p>
<p>So one day, Mr. Moore goes to google.com on his computer at work, and guess what, its not the real google.com&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/073008-dns-attack-writer-a-victim.html">The news article</a></p>

  <p>So lots of people use computers, and lots of people have harddrives.</p>
<p>At my work I deal with lots and lots of computers and lots and lots of drives. So during a week I see plenty of failing drives, just because of the statistics.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techchee.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/double-boil-your-failed-hard-drive-to-recover-its-precious-data-271107.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So now-a-days I run a &ldquo;smart test&rdquo; on the drive to see how it is. Unfortunately most drive testers and smart tests are crap. So I made my own and I want to share it with you&hellip;.</p>
<p>It runs in Linux of course, and all it needs is a program called smartctl. (If you don&rsquo;t have it and you are running Ubuntu, just run &ldquo;apt-get install smartmontools&rdquo; )</p>
<p>Here is how you can get it and run it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ wget a.xkyle.com/smarttest
$ bash smarttest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats it! Just give it about 2 minutes to run.  Here is an example output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hours: 27519
SMART Errors: 0
Reallocated / Pending: 2 / 0
Read Speed: 41 MB/s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WARNING: This drive has over 26,280 (3 years) hours on it and should not be used as a Primary
WARNING: This drive has some reallocated sectors, this shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a primary and requires judgment if it is to be used for a secondary</p>
<p>Its  pretty self explainitory if you know about drives. If you want to know more about smart paramaters, check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis,_and_Reporting_Technology">wikipedia article.</a></p>
