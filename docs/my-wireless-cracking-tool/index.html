            <p>I&rsquo;ve become a semi-expert on wireless networking and their security features.. and how to get around them. Before I continue I want to emphasize:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The act of cracking encryption is not illegal just like picking a lock is not illegal. It is the unauthorized access of that network which is illegal, just like breaking and entering is illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So. To sum it up, there are two types of encryption. There is the weak kind (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">wep</a>) and the strong kind (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">wpa</a>). WEP can be broken in about 5-10 minutes. WPA can be broken in about 24 hours (as long as their password is in your password try-out list).</p>

<p>The actual process or hacking into a network like this requires a suite of tools called the <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org">aircrack-ng suite</a>. You can read their tutorials and such, and I highly recommend you do if you want to get into this sort of thing. It&rsquo;s a lot of FUN! Be prepared to learn linux while you are at it&hellip;.</p>

<p>But, once you understand what you are doing, you will appreciate the tool I have written. It automates the process of getting the keys. I wrote it as a type of &ldquo;set-it-and-forget-it&rdquo; tool that I could just leave running. It isn&rsquo;t too clean, but if you can read bash scripting you can figure it out.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_137&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Here is a screen shot of my tool cracking wep&rdquo;]<a href="../uploads/screenshot.jpg"><img src="../uploads/screenshot.jpg" alt="Here is a screen shot of my tool cracking wep" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Remember! Don&rsquo;t try to just run this tool without understanding what it does and how to read it. If you haven&rsquo;t breaking a wep key manually you don&rsquo;t want to run this. It does WEP and WPA cracking (saving the handshake for later). Good luck! I will provide minimal support via comments on this post. Don&rsquo;t forget to have your radio in monitor mode first, and if you areÂ  going to do wpa you need the <a href="http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~p_larbig/wlan/">mdk3</a> tool.</p>
