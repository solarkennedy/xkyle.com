            <p>I recently read <a href="http://powerevolution.tumblr.com/post/133543612986/why-are-so-many-millennials-so-uncool">&ldquo;Why Are SO Many Millennials SO Uncool?&quot;</a>.
Let's start with a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*For the purpose of this writing, I’m defining “cool” as those who don’t
conform, who don’t always fit in nor do they try to, and who follow their own
path; and “uncool” as those who dress, act, and have the same tastes as the
masses and are vulnerable to corporate influences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm by no means some sort of authority on <em>coolness</em>. By this definition
there is certainly some degree of subjectivity, but this definition has a hint
of personal-values embedded into it.</p>
<p>In otherwords, this is more than &ldquo;I don't like black socks and sandles&rdquo;, but
more like &ldquo;I value non-corporate-sellouts.&rdquo; At least this value extends beyond
<em>just</em> personal taste.</p>
<h2 id="individuality-versus-popularity">Individuality Versus Popularity</h2>
<p>Anyone can choose to adopt this value. I can appreciate it.</p>
<p>If fully adopted, it seems like this would encompass normal corporate branding
stuff, as well as things that are simply &ldquo;popular&rdquo;. By this definition, wearing
a popular brand name or adopting a trendy style is &ldquo;uncool&rdquo;. This is at odds
with the definition of &ldquo;cool&rdquo; that I learned in middle-school. In fact, in
middle-school the definition of cool was the exact <strong>opposite</strong> of the author's
definition.</p>
<p>This is fine. As we mature into adults, some people outgrow this definition of
coolness. Others do not.</p>

<td>Corporate Gucci Bag: Uncool</td>
<td>Handmade Etsy Bag: Cool</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I can get behind this. I also individuality over popularity. I also dislike
corporate influences. (or heck, external influences in general)</p>
<h2 id="examining-my-tech-wardrobe">Examining My (Tech) Wardrobe</h2>
<p>One of my other personal values is <em>consistency</em>. If I'm going to adopt this
value and be consistent, then perhaps I should examine my wardrobe&hellip;</p>
<p>What external corporate ends am I promoting with my wardrobe? Well let's start
with all these technology tshirts:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="../uploads/docker_shirt.jpg" alt="Docker Shirt"></th>
<th><img src="../uploads/openssl_shirt.jpg" alt="OpenSSL Shirt"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Docker Shirt: Uncool</td>
<td>OpenSSL Shirt: Cool</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both Docker and OpenSSL are open source, but wearing a Docker shirt implicitly
promotes the <em>Docker Company</em>. On the other hand, OpenSSL is goverend by the
OpenSSL Software Foundation. Is wearing a Docker shirt on par with showing
off your Gucci bag?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="../uploads/ubuntu_shirt.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Shirt"></th>
<th><img src="../uploads/debian_shirt.jpg" alt="Debian Shirt"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ubuntu Shirt: Uncool</td>
<td>Debian Shirt: Cool</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Ubuntu is a product of <em>Canonical</em>. Debian doesn't have any corporate
counterpart.  Is wearing an Ubuntu shirt uncool because you are providing free
advertising for a corporate entity?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="../uploads/aws_shirt.jpg" alt="AWS Shirt"></th>
<th><img src="../uploads/openstack_shirt.jpg" alt="Openstack Shirt"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AWS Shirt: Uncool</td>
<td>Openstack Shirt: Uncool too</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I don't know man, I don't think Openstack shirts are cool either&hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="nontech">Non-tech</h2>
<p>These above examples are given mostly because the represent a large portion
of my wardrobe. In general the same principle of rejecting corporate sponsors
carries over to non-tech shirts.</p>
<p>I dare say that even wearing shirts with logos of your current or previous
employers are <strong>not</strong> cool.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, wearing something that promotes another company's products, I guess
is uncool, even if you like the product or even contribute to it. The root cause
is that you are allowing yourself to be treated as a means to their promotion?</p>
<p>Of course the act of trying to be cool in uncool in itself, so I'm pretty sure
I'm forever destined to remain&hellip; uncool.</p>
