  <p>SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) as coined by Google in 2003, came into prominence in 2016 with the release of <a href="https://sre.google/books/">&ldquo;The SRE Book&rdquo;</a>.
It defines a particular job in an engineering org.
This job is mostly focused on of course, reliability, but also performance, observability/monitoring, code deployment, capacity planning, and many other adjacent activities.</p>
<p>Some people say SRE is Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;version of DevOps&rdquo; (aka a &ldquo;DevOps implementation&rdquo;).
This is a little tricky to talk about, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>, started as a rallying cry for shortening deployment times and adding more automation in the SDLC, has turned into a role itself.
There are lots of job openings for &ldquo;Devops Engineer&rdquo;, and engineers really identify that term, some calling themselves &ldquo;a devop&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;devop&rdquo; term, for the purpose of this blog post, SRE as an implementation of the DevOps philosophy is close enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-stories-we-tell-ourselves">The Stories We Tell Ourselves</h2>
<p>Our jobs titles can strongly influence our personal identities.
Think of your job title as a <a href="https://www.xkyle.com/We-Software-Engineers-Are-All-Already-Prompt-Engineers/">mini prompt</a> fed to your own personal neural network, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a good SRE.
I build reliable systems.
I&rsquo;m good enough, I&rsquo;m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-i-dont-like-sre">Why I Don&rsquo;t Like SRE</h2>
<p>To me, reliability has never been the top priority for most of the systems I&rsquo;ve managed.
It just hasn&rsquo;t.
Certainly reliability is one important aspect of a good system, but only to a degree.</p>
<p>For any individual job, there may be a time that reliability is job 1, but other times it might be performance, or cost efficiency.
There are lots of tradeoffs to be made like:</p>
<ul>
<li>For security, we need all logins to funnel through this central server</li>
<li>For efficiency, we need to run in 2 availability zones instead of 3.</li>
<li>For performance, we need to run the database as a singleton instead of being distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to be boxed in, as simple as that.
For that reason, I don&rsquo;t identify as an SRE, and I just stick to &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; (luckily not a protected title in the US).
That way I don&rsquo;t let a reliability bias hold me back from making hard tradeoffs when the time comes.</p>
