<p>Whenever possible, I try to write Puppet code that is purgable and
&ldquo;Comment Safe&rdquo;. That is not a very good description. What I mean is, Puppet
code that removes resources from a system when the corresponding Puppet
code is &ldquo;Commented&rdquo; out of a manifest. Lets look at a few examples.</p>

<h3 id="example-managed-sudo">Example: Managed Sudo</h3>

<p>Lets say you used this <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/saz/sudo">popular sudo module</a>
with the following params:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class { 'sudo':
  purge =&gt; true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Great start. All future <code>sudo::conf</code> blocks you write will <em>automatically</em> disappear
from the host:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">sudo::conf { 'web':
   source =&gt; 'puppet:///files/etc/sudoers.d/web',
 }
 
# Commenting out for now. Automatically is purged from the server
# sudo::conf { 'admins':
#   priority =&gt; 10,
#   content  =&gt; &quot;%admins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL&quot;,
# }
</code></pre>

<p>Good stuff. Do this.</p>

<h3 id="example-managed-firewall">Example: Managed Firewall</h3>

<p>How about another example with the
<a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall">Puppetlabs Firewall module</a>?</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># Automatically remove rules that are not declared
resources { &quot;firewall&quot;:
  purge =&gt; true
} 

# Production needs 111 open
firewall { '111 open port 111':
  dport =&gt; 111
}
# Tried this but didn't work. Commenting out for now
# Automatically removed from the server when I commented it out
# firewall { '112 open port 112':
#   dport =&gt; 112
# }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-point">The Point?</h3>

<p>The point here is that we should encourage a culture of purging. Having
resources get automatically purged when you comment them out from puppet
is great.</p>

<p>Of course, this is obsoleted in the short-lived world of docker or possibly
Amazon EC2. But for those engineers who work on long lived servers, this
prevents cruft.</p>

<h3 id="going-further-purging-packages">Going Further: Purging Packages</h3>

<p>I want to purge packages. If someone installs a package not controlled by
Puppet, I want puppet to purge it. Crazy I know.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">package { 'apache': ensure =&gt; installed }

# No longer using php
# But puppet leaves this behind!
# package { 'php5': ensure =&gt; installed }
</code></pre>

<p>Of course puppet will leave the package behind. I should be doing <code>ensure =&gt; purged</code>
right?</p>

<p>But what if the package is deep within nested classes or simply manually installed?</p>

<p>Some day I would like to get to the point where I at least get notified when
puppet detects packages that don&rsquo;t need to be there. I&rsquo;m open to suggestions on
how to do this.</p>

<h3 id="going-further-purging-etc">Going Further: Purging /etc/</h3>

<p>Most of the time stale configuration leftover in /etc/ causes no harm.</p>

<p>But what about cron jobs in <code>/etc/cron.d</code>? I would love to purge them, but there
are non-puppet controlled things installed by system packages. If <em>everything</em> was
a puppet module this could eventually be achieved, but it would be too hard
to keep in sync with upstream package changes.</p>

<p>Purgin on a per-app basis with things like <a href="https://github.com/sensu/sensu-puppet">sensu</a>,
<a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apache">apache</a>, and <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/saz/sudo">sudo</a>
are a great start.</p>

<h3 id="crossing-the-line-purging-var-lib-mysql">Crossing the Line: Purging /var/lib/mysql</h3>

<p>Seems like if you asked puppet to install mysql databases, and then
commented them out, you would <em>not</em> want puppet to purge them.</p>

<p>The subtle difference here might be the difference between <strong>configuration</strong> and
<strong>data</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Whenever possible I try to <code>purge =&gt; true</code> on whatever I can. I would like to see
this as the <strong>default</strong> in new puppet modules.</p>

<p>Someday I would like us to purge more than just files and iptables rules.</p>
