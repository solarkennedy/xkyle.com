  <p>Recently a DNS expert found a flaw in the way that DNS servers talk to other DNS servers to get records that allows interested parties (hackers) to insert their own records. If you need a primer: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning">Wikipedia link</a>.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; a DNS flaw is no fun without a tool to use it. So this guy &ldquo;HD Moore&rdquo; wrote a program (script) that takes advantage of this and makes it relatively easy for someone to use something called <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/framework/">Metasploit</a> to tinker with it. Cool!</p>
<p>Turns out that it works, and people are fixing their DNS servers so that this can&rsquo;t happen. (I fixed mine as soon as the fix was out.) But not everyone can fix their own, often they are at the mercy of their ISP&rsquo;s. (Have you ever called up your ISP&rsquo;s help desk and told them they need to upgrade their DNS servers to protect them against cache poisoning? Heheheh.. right)</p>
<p>So one day, Mr. Moore goes to google.com on his computer at work, and guess what, its not the real google.com&hellip;</p>

<p>Well played sir. Well played.</p>
