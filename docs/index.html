  Disclaimer: This blog post is a deep dive in to the topic of Linux container storage, specifically looking at Netflix&rsquo;s Open Source Titus container platform. Netflix happens to be my employer, but nothing in this blog post is secret or talk about anything that isn&rsquo;t already open source.
Intro (The Problem) Container storage is a complex subject. Getting a hook into the right place to be able to do storage syscalls in Linux for a container requires orchestration help between the storage driver and the container orchestrator.

In Part 1, I discussed the current state of the art of container storage with the CSI+kubernetes, and its limitations.
In this Part 2, I&rsquo;ll discuss why mounting storage is difficult in containers, especially in user namespaces are in use.

  I recently bought a pair of Novostella 20W Smart LED Flood Lights. These lights are RGBCW (Red/Blue/Green/Cold/Warm) and use the ubiquitous ESP8266 controller on the Tuya TYLC4-IPEX.
From the previous blog post we learned that the ESP8266 is connected to the LED controller in the following way:
 GPIO 04: PWM Channel 1 (Red) GPIO 05: PWM Channel 5 (Color Temp) GPIO 12: PWM Channel 2 (Green) GPIO 13: PWM Channel 4 (White) GPIO 14: PWM Channel 3 (Blue) GPIO 0-3,6,7,11,1: Not used  My particular version of this Novostella Flood Light had the latest version of their software, which means I did have to break the glass and solder up a programmer to flash WLED on it.

  I recently bought a pair of Novostella 20W Smart LED Flood Lights. These lights are RGBCW (Red/Blue/Green/Cold/Warm) and use the ubiquitous ESP8266 controller on the Tuya TYLC4-IPEX.
Based on other guides thought that I could use the tuya-convert tool to flash them with my own software OTA (over the air). Unfortunately the latest revision of these lights uses a patched firmware that tuya-convert does not understand. This means that these Flood Lamps cannot be re-flashed without being taken apart.

  This is my &ldquo;Sutro Cat Tower&rdquo;, modeled after the real Sutro Tower in San Francisco CA.
It features:
 7&rsquo; 3&quot; (221cm) Tall 369 Individually addressable RGB LEDs ESP8266 programming (timers, dimming, &ldquo;smart&rdquo; features), code Fleece-lined platforms for the cats Modular wood construction  Honestly it is too tall, I&rsquo;ll have to come up with something to make it easier for the cats to jump up into the upper platforms.

  For the purpose of this blog post, my definition of plugin is:
 A method of extending the functionality of program without forking it
 In particular, I&rsquo;ll be looking at methods of extending Golang (go) programs.
Official Golang Plugins Official Golang Plugins are a native way of extending go codebases without forking them.
How They Work Official Golang Plugins work by compiling your plugin in a special way:
go build -buildmode=plugin  This build mode can output a .
