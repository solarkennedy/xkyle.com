  This is a joint talk with one of my Netflix Coworkers JS Jeannotte.
In this talk we survey the different options for running stateful workloads on EC2.
We also present a hybrid method of using containers to run workloads using Kubelet in standalone mode, combined with the EC2 replace-root-volume API. This method enables us to iterate quickly through:
Loading new container images and restarting kubelet for workload software upgrades Rebooting the server into a new OS and kernel quickly for upgrading everything else All without losing the on-disk state.

  NOTE: This blog post is just a physical teardown and documentation of the device&rsquo;s advertised bluetooth capabilities. No reverse engineering was done (I&rsquo;m not that good).
I recently attended AWS re:Invent 2023, and the badge had a curious circular object attached to it.
In extremely small print it had some sort of serial, 00234867 silk screened on the case.
Inside was a small circular PCB and a CR2016 battery:

  I recently hosted a &ldquo;Great Apple Tasting Experiment&rdquo;, where some friends and I blind tasted 27 different apple cultivars.
Luckily I live near Berkely Bowl, and incredible grocery story with even more than this number of unique apples. Special thanks to the cashier who checked us out.
Here is the list were were able to buy in this November of 2023:
Juici Braeburn Rave Ambrosia Beni Shogun Fugi Red Delicious Smitten Granny Smith Ambrosia Pink Lady Jazz Opal Autumn Glory Gala Lady Golden Delicious Sweetango Lady Alice Apple Jonagold Gold Rush Hunnyz Envy Rome Beauty Organic Sweetie Honey Crisp Sugarbee Crimson Gold We all tried and rated each of these apples, without knowing their name.

  Here is a sampling of craft projects for Halloween 2023 that I made with wife help. Click on a picture to see a full size image. Sorry for the terrible image quality.
Transmutation Circle Materials:
Charcoal chalk LED Candles Magnet Wire Wemos D1 controller running WLED Straight edge, vinyl stencils, wire/compass. It is kinda surreal to see this in real life. This thing is big enough to create a human from raw elements!

  Sometimes it is uself to have an EC2 Machine Image (AMI) change its behavior depending on its runtime environment. This adds complexity to the AMI, but reduces the complexity of having to maintain N AMIs with N behaviors.
One of the hardest things about an AMI to change at runtime is the Linux kernel. By the time you are acutally running, the Linux kernel is there, and it is too late to upgrade or change.

  Python Manhole When working with a complex python daemon, I really appreciated the python-manhole library. This tool allows you to listen on a Unix domain socket, and serve a REPL, get stack traces, and more.
From the README, it is as simple as this:
Install it:
pip install manhole Add it to your python code somewhere in the start sequence:
import manhole ... def main(): manhole.install() # this will start the daemon thread .

  Sometimes I hear the phrase &ldquo;Stock Kubernetes&rdquo; and wonder exactly what one means when they say that. Often it is in contrast to a &ldquo;Managed&rdquo; kubernetes (k8s) offering, for example (just the big three):
Amazon EKS Google GKE Azure AKS But these are all on cloud providers. When someone says &ldquo;Stock Kubernetes&rdquo;, they may mean they want to run k8s on a cloud provider, but not use the cloud provider&rsquo;s service.

  Prompt engineering is an the emerging practice of talking to an AI to get a desired outcome.
As a software engineer, I would like to make the case that we were already doing this, just our &ldquo;AIs&rdquo; were extremely primitive and error-prone.
ChatGPT and Copilot are getting very close (in March 2023) to being less error-prone than I am.
I am a Natural Intelligence with a Finite Prompt I&rsquo;m 39 and this is deep, but my &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; is all I can remember from the last couple of decades of my professional experience.

  Back in 2016 I did a comparison of text-based browser here.
Back then this was the state of the art (elinks):
This is speaking generously, with a particularly text-friendly example!
Now, in 2023, there are two new text-based browsers that are incredible. Because they are backed by normal browser engines, we no longer have to be impressed by features like &ldquo;color support&rdquo;!
Browsh Browsh is a modern text browser backed by the Firefox (gecko) rendering engine.

  I&rsquo;m trying out the 2018 Palm PVG100 as my daily driver cell phone.
Sure, it is ancient by smartphone standards, but it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m in the future whenever I use it.
Plus it pairs well with my OneNetbook 4:
Reasons for using this:
It is cool It satisfies my &ldquo;under $100 device on my person&rdquo; constraint It discourages &ldquo;bad scrolling habits&rdquo; It fits in my wallet Why USB Tethering I think USB Tethering is underrated.
