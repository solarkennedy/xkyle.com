            <p>I was talking with my girlfriend recently, and I told her that her &ldquo;RA Class&rdquo; (RA is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_assistant">resident assistant</a>, someone who lives on campus to assist other residents) is a &ldquo;Boom Boom&rdquo; class. She is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niceville">Niceville</a> and had never heard of the term.

<p>In an effort to locate some sort of source for my definition besides anecdotes of the people I knew, I was only able to find other personal references (myspace, facebook) coincidentally from people in Tampa. Turns out that this term appears to originate specifically from Tampa!</p>

<p>Here is my evidence:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boom%20boom">Urban Dictionary </a>Claiming this fact<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boom%20boom">

<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Boom_(disambiguation)">Nothing on Wikipedia</a></p></li>

<li><p>That is all I have. Its mostly anecdotal.</p></li>
