        <div>DRBD is the bomb. Think Raid 1 over the network between two servers. It enables sysadmins (in combination with heartbeat) to increase service uptime, while enabling server downtime. This means you can do kernel updates, do hardware maintenance, upgrade ram, move the server to another rack, etc, all while keeping the service up.
Because DRBD is often used in high availability scenario, there isn't much room for experimentation with in-production systems.</div>

        <div>I apologize for the verbose post. This is a complicated problem and it merits full explanation. If you are experiencing this problem I advise you to avoid skimming and read it very carefully :)
Sometimes you come across a problem that is a little more complex than average. Sometimes it is problem that is rare enough that there isn't an obvious answer in the first google hint. Sometimes a problem may seem unavoidable, which leads to work-arounds, and before you know it you have a mess.</div>

        <div>So you have some new harddrives. Maybe you are thinking about building a DIY storage server? Maybe some Raid? Maybe you just want to know if your drives are performing as well as when you bought them? How can you know? Measurement is Knowing.
The thing about benchmarks is that you always must be skeptical. Each system's particular disks, controller, raid level and settings, cpu, ram, filesystem, operating system, etc can GREATLY affect the performance of a system.</div>

        <div>Starting with the new year, I decided to move my xkyle.com domain and related stuff away from my account at Dreamhost, a shared hosting server, to my virtual machine at Tummy.com. I have nothing but good things to say about Dreamhost though, they are excellent at what they do. However, I wanted to do more than what a shared hosting provider could do for me, I needed Root!
Moving my websites and dns to a dedicated server grants me the ability to implement a few technologies to usher in the new year.</div>

        <div>I was thinking about moving my Wii, and relocating it to a more conspicuous place. I was annoyed at my sensor bar getting in the way:

I knew that the sensor bar was just 2 IR LEDs. So why not just build those LEDs right into the TV? One less cord to lay around. Lets open it up!

I used the given board that had 2 White LEDs that lit up the Westinghouse Logo.</div>

The circles represent actors, the diamonds represent movies they have been in. Pink is for actresses and blue is for actors. The numbers represent the numbers in their name: First, Last. Question marks indicate the number in their name is 3,4,6, or 9 letters. The center actress is what we are after. Note there are no clues for her name, but she has been in 13 movies.</div>

They make great home servers, appropriate for file sharing, exporting media files for your devices (DLNA), making backups (backuppc), etc.

        <div>Bash is my favorite computer language. I also love writing programs to help human problems.
Inspired by this online Boggle solver, I decided to write my own solver while my friends were too busy playing the game and having fun :)
If you would like to test my work, here is the code:

But don't you wish you could peel back reality and see what is happening with the physics from the inside? Well now you can, with the help of a Wii Balance Board.

For the setup you need these ingredients:
  Wii Balance Board
  Computer with Bluetooth
  Linux, preferably Ubuntu</div>

How much would you pay for such a neat little device?</div>
