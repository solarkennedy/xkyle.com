(You may have noticed the cameo in episode 1.) Founded in 2001, an uncountable number of spoofs have been made, and are stored at the sister site, ytmnd.com.

<p>Also, being in Tampa, I live close to the <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology </a>headquarters in Clearwater. Recently a YoureTheManNowDog has been created that exposes some of the terrible things that the church of <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a> has done. They are a very dangerous cult using blackmail, scare tactics, and a strong legal team to achieve their ends.</p>
<p>Many people don't know the specifics about their beliefs, nor are they aware of the underhanded tactics they use to shut down those who oppose them. I encourage everyone to see this ytmnd, then read on for how to help. (Click on the image below to see it in a new window.)</p>

Seen it? Terrible isn't it. But what can we do? Expose. How? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb">Google bomb</a> . If you are not familiar with the term, here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb">Wikipedia article</a> on it. Basically the procedure makes a certain page come to the top of search results for a certian term. In this case, the ytmnd will come up when someone searches for the word, <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a>. Then anyone looking for information will be shown the truth.</p>
<p>You can help! If you have any web page, blog, forum, in your signature, mailing list, anything, create links! Anywhere you use the word, <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a>, link it to <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/"><a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/</a></a>. The more links in place, the more Google's search algorithm will believe it is the webpage most relevant to the word, <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a>. That is it! Simple. A successful Google-bomb will bring this site to light, and put <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a> under even more scrutiny. Perhaps over time the word <a href="http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/">Scientology</a> will be associated with its horrific deeds, and be put to an end.</p>
