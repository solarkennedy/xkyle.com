      <description>Nagios. So familiar. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve run Nagios at every job I have ever had.
Talk to most ops people, even at really big places, and they will probably admit to using it.
Puppet&amp;rsquo;s exported resources takes away some of the pain, but sometimes I think to myself, there must be a better way to do this. Sensu might be that better way.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try it out, but gosh, I am SO lazy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tired of configuring Nagios by hand. Just tired. I always forget to do stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ll add a new host, or stick in a raid card, add a new website, whatever, and forget to add a nagios check for it.

So it happened. You setup a server, put critical infrastructure on it, but forgot to monitor it. It goes down, bad stuff happens. Your boss asks, why weren&amp;rsquo;t we monitoring this?</description>
