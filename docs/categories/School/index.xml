      <description>This semester I took a class on Discrete Wavelets. It was awesome. The coolest part was our group final project. My group had the best topic by far: Decoding a Captcha! (Click on any of the following images to view them full size)

We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen Captchas before. They are used on websites to make sure that the person on the website is a real human, not a computer program.</description>

      <description>I was talking with my girlfriend recently, and I told her that her &amp;ldquo;RA Class&amp;rdquo; (RA is short for resident assistant, someone who lives on campus to assist other residents) is a &amp;ldquo;Boom Boom&amp;rdquo; class. She is from Niceville and had never heard of the term. I knew it as a slang term for a low level class that required no effort, taken simply for credit.
In an effort to locate some sort of source for my definition besides anecdotes of the people I knew, I was only able to find other personal references (myspace, facebook) coincidentally from people in Tampa.</description>
