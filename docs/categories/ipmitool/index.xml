      <description>Working at Intel has been a great experience. I wish I could have stayed longer, but in the end we decided to part ways.

There is no need to go to the BIOS to configure ipmi. You can use IPMItool to configure it in-band. This is my first underused command:
(disclaimer: not all IPMI interfaces / bios versions / hardware platforms are equal.</description>
