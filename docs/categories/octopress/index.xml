      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Been a Great Ride There is no doubt that Wordpress is a great piece of software. As much as people love to hate on PHP, it runs a lot of the internet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been running Wordpress personally and professionally for years. It only gets better. I was only hacked once :)
