      <description>I apologize for the verbose post. This is a complicated problem and it merits fullÂ explanation. If you are experiencing this problem I advise you to avoid skimming and read it very carefully :)
Sometimes you come across a problem that is a little more complex than average. Sometimes it is problem that is rare enough that there isn&amp;rsquo;t an obvious answer in the first google hint. Sometimes a problem may seem unavoidable, which leads to work-arounds, and before you know it you have a mess.</description>
