      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Been a Great Ride There is no doubt that Wordpress is a great piece of software. As much as people love to hate on PHP, it runs a lot of the internet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been running Wordpress personally and professionally for years. It only gets better. I was only hacked once :)
Rethinking What I Need Since moving to a Low End Box, my resources have been tight. Even on a tuned system, I can&amp;rsquo;t run much more interesting things than my Nginx+PHPfpm+MySQL.</description>

      <description>Working at Intel has been a great experience. I wish I could have stayed longer, but in the end we decided to part ways.
During my stay I learned lots of stuff. I would like to boil my experience down to my top Linux commands.
The List  git: Lots of git. syscfg: Managing bios settings from within Linux. Nice. (Intel platforms) setupbios: More bios settings from within Linux. (Dell platforms) puppet: I actually enjoy manually running puppet.</description>

      <description>Every job has metawork. Sometimes it becomes so commonplace that we just forget about it. We should never forget about it. I hope this blog post reminds you of what your metawork is. For the purposes of this blog post it will focus on code-centric stuff, but could apply to anything.
Different jobs have different types of metawork. Sometimes it is just paperwork. Other times it is called &amp;ldquo;overhead&amp;rdquo;. Commonly it is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Process&amp;rdquo;.</description>
