      <description>Working at Intel has been a great experience. I wish I could have stayed longer, but in the end we decided to part ways.
During my stay I learned lots of stuff. I would like to boil my experience down to my top Linux commands.
The List  git: Lots of git. syscfg: Managing bios settings from within Linux. Nice. (Intel platforms) setupbios: More bios settings from within Linux. (Dell platforms) puppet: I actually enjoy manually running puppet.</description>

      <description>What? I&amp;rsquo;ve written lots of crappy Puppet modules. Here is a slightly less crappy module that can help you configure BIOS settings on your servers for you.
It works on Dell C class servers and Intel platforms. Please pull request or email me if you want to have it work on something else too!
Why? BIOS settings should be considered configuration just like any other configuration, and hence managed by your configuration management tool, if possible.</description>

      <title>An IPMI SEL Viewing Shootout!</title>

      <description>UPDATE (2015-02-18) Albert Chu from FreeIPMI commented that FreeIPMI does NOT attempt to decode OEM events by default. These are events that are OEM specific, so each motherboard may require a different interpretation.
FreeIPMI has a --interpret-oem-data option and possibly in conjunction with the -W assumesystemevent option, to attempt to decode these.
Unfortunately I no longer have the motherboard I originally ran these on. I might do a followup post with a new motherboard with similar &amp;ldquo;issues&amp;rdquo; and see how FreeIPMI compares to the other tools with these options.</description>
