      <description>Every job has metawork. Sometimes it becomes so commonplace that we just forget about it. We should never forget about it. I hope this blog post reminds you of what your metawork is. For the purposes of this blog post it will focus on code-centric stuff, but could apply to anything.
Different jobs have different types of metawork. Sometimes it is just paperwork. Other times it is called &amp;ldquo;overhead&amp;rdquo;. Commonly it is referred to as &amp;ldquo;Process&amp;rdquo;.</description>
