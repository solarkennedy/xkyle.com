      <description>I was thinking about moving my Wii, and relocating it to a more conspicuous place. I was annoyed at my sensor bar getting in the way:

I knew that the sensor bar was just 2 IR LEDs. So why not just build those LEDs right into the TV? One less cord to lay around. Lets open it up!

I used the given board that had 2 White LEDs that lit up the Westinghouse Logo.</description>

      <description>I like to think about how games work, in the case of Jenga, it is just physics!
But don&amp;rsquo;t you wish you could peel back reality and see what is happening with the physics from the inside? Well now you can, with the help of a Wii Balance Board.

For the setup you need these ingredients:
 Wii Balance Board
 Computer with Bluetooth
 Linux, preferably Ubuntu
 Jenga Set, alternatively &amp;ldquo;Tension Tower&amp;ldquo;</description>
