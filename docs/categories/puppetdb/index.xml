      <description>Why So you have a decent amount of things configured in Puppet. Great!
Are you finding that you have to manually update your DNS entries when things change, like when new hosts or added, or additional services are created?
Why? Your DNS zone files will forever be out of date, waiting for humans to update them. Just say no. Puppet already knows what the ip addresses and hostnames of your servers, why not take advantage of that existing data?</description>
