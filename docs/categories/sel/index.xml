      <description>UPDATE (2015-02-18) Albert Chu from FreeIPMI commented that FreeIPMI does NOT attempt to decode OEM events by default. These are events that are OEM specific, so each motherboard may require a different interpretation.
FreeIPMI has a --interpret-oem-data option and possibly in conjunction with the -W assumesystemevent option, to attempt to decode these.
Unfortunately I no longer have the motherboard I originally ran these on. I might do a followup post with a new motherboard with similar &amp;ldquo;issues&amp;rdquo; and see how FreeIPMI compares to the other tools with these options.</description>
