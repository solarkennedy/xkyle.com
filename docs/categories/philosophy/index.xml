      <description>Now hear me out, I used to be a hater. It seems that the more people blog, the more the internet is loaded up with wasted bandwidth and ad space. The truth is that blogging has a very small marginal cost, and usually blogging occupies time that would not otherwise be spent doing &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo; things.
But! What if all of humanity blogged, and then we could aggregate all blogs on the internet.</description>
