      <description>I love my low end boxes. I also love mosh.
Low end boxes usually are tight on resources, so Dropbear is often used as a lightweight ssh server. Mosh is mostly tested with openssh-client/server, so I think there are some bugs.
But it can work, just make sure:
  You are using the same version of mosh on the server as you are on your client. (otherwise they may not support the same command line options)</description>
