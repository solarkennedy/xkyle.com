      <description>Starting with the new year, I decided to move my xkyle.com domain and related stuff away from my account at Dreamhost, a shared hosting server, to my virtual machine at Tummy.com. I have nothing but good things to say about Dreamhost though, they are excellent at what they do. However, I wanted to do more than what a shared hosting provider could do for me, I needed Root!
Moving my websites and dns to a dedicated server grants me the ability to implement a few technologies to usher in the new year.</description>
