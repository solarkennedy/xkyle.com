      <description>The next step in our Lasertag construction project is the preperation of the boxes for our components. We have decided to put all of the electronics in a backpack. But the backpack will need some I/O. We need a rj-45 for the gun, two for the arm-band, a usb for the key, and a hole for the power switch and power plug. How do we do it? We need square holes&amp;hellip; Well, the best and nicest way I can think to do it is to use a little thing called a roto-zip bit.</description>
