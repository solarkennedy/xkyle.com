            <p>Picking a server hostname is a<a href="http://xkcd.com/910/"> big deal</a>. I've seen quite a few, lets traverse the hostname-awesomeness-continuum and see if we can learn something.</p>
<h1 id="worsest">Worsest</h1>
<ul>
<li>morpheous</li>
<li>trinity</li>
<li>alf</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do these suck? These names have <strong>no information</strong> what-so-ever. If you see a server alert, you have no clue what services are actually down. It might as well be a random string. IT is a random string.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pro Tip: Don't give make server hostnames random strings.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't do this would you?
hostname <code>shuf -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words</code></p>
<p><a href="../uploads/bios-meme.jpg"><img src="../uploads/bios-meme-300x225.jpg" alt="bios-meme"></a>
Additionally, the name almost <strong>enables</strong> admins to overload the server with multiple services. &ldquo;What server should we run DNS on? Put it on Alf, it has some spare cycles.&rdquo; That conversation would not happen if the server was called &ldquo;db04&rdquo;. Also we have no way to judge the urgency of a server outage without being very familiar with the services it provides.</p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn't scale. Say it with me here: **Servers are not Precious Snowflakes! **And no, giving your server's custy names does NOT increase your security. Prove me wrong.</p>
<h1 id="worser">Worser</h1>
<ul>
<li>msr2</li>
<li>eln4</li>
<li>wtf5</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../uploads/36743853.jpg"><img src="../uploads/36743853-300x225.jpg" alt="36743853"></a>These names sometimes come from ancient department abbreviations  or maybe three unrelated words. They also might hint at being part of a collection, but many times they are indicators of server cruft. For example, wtf5 could be the fifth server in a long line of failures. wtf1-4 don't exist anymore, sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>Don't do this! I appreciate the brevity, but save it for DNS CNAMES. I can understand naming something &ldquo;server2&rdquo; during an upgrade from &ldquo;server&rdquo;, but unless you have good reason, rename it back when you are done. Future employees will thank you and it makes your infrastructure _<strong>feel</strong> _cleaner.</p>
<p>And no, incrementing the number on the end of your hostname on every new server rebuild does not make you more secure. Prove me wrong again.</p>
<h1 id="worse">Worse</h1>
<ul>
<li>srv001-100</li>
<li>dell01-08</li>
<li>node01-99</li>
</ul>
<p>We are getting slightly better here I think. This is another anti-pattern I have seen in the wild: pick a generic name and span it across the range. Fill up the servers as needed.</p>
<p>Whyyy!!? Again, there is no inherent information or context from the hostname. I have no idea what runs on dell07. Sure I know it is a Dell. Or is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro Tip: Bake tribal knowledge into your infrastructure by setting descriptive hostnames.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="better"><strong>Better</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>clientname</li>
<li>different-client</li>
<li>legacy-name (that has no relevant meaning today)</li>
</ul>
<p>The world isn't perfect. Sometimes it does make sense to group services by a client's name, or maybe because you have some legacy that you want self-contained on a single server. Could be as good as it gets.</p>
<h1 id="betterer">Betterer</h1>
<ul>
<li>dns1-5</li>
<li>backend01-04</li>
<li>fe01-99</li>
</ul>
<p>These are nice. I have a good idea about what these servers do, how important it is if one goes down, what services are impacted, etc. These are pretty much bestest, honestly.</p>
<p>I'm conflicted on leading zeros. Future proofing is one thing, but how many dns servers do you honestly anticipate building? Better than this though: [ mail, mail1, mail2, mail3 ]. Ug. Renaming is not nearly as hard as people think. Hostnames are **NOT **permanent.</p>
<h1 id="bestest">Bestest</h1>
<ul>
<li>db01a</li>
<li>nfs01-04</li>
<li>mail</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../uploads/36744679.jpg"><img src="../uploads/36744679-300x300.jpg" alt="36744679"></a>Yes. To me these are perfect. The very name of the server implies what runs on it, and deters admins from running other things on it. We are talking <em>one logical service per server</em>.</p>
<p>I like db01a because it implies that there is a pair, db01b. (Bonus points for a db01 floating ip, if applicable)</p>
<p>mail: It is the mail server. Don't let your co-workers tell you that you are un-creative. They don't even <em>know</em>. Not every situation calls out for an HA solution, sometimes it is ok to have a mail server.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have no idea what your situation is, don't listen to me. Picking server hostnames is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law_of_triviality">bikeshed </a>problem. Pick one and move on with your life.</p>
