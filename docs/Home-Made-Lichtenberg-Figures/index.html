<meta property="og:description" content="For winter 2016 I made Lichenberg Figures. I used a 5kV 10mA (50W) neon light transformer. I also experimented with a 2kW microwave oven transformer, but found that the lower powered neon transformer produced finer, better, and safer results.
To produce the figures, I would first apply the electricity to the wood, often at the corners. Initially the resistance of the wood is not sufficient to allow any burning. Then I would use a spray bottle full of water/baking soda to moisten the surface of the wood until the electricity could find the path of least resistance and start the burning reaction." />

            <p>For winter 2016 I made
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure">Lichenberg Figures</a>.
I used a 5kV 10mA (50W) neon light transformer. I also experimented with
a 2kW microwave oven transformer, but found that the lower powered neon
transformer produced finer, better, and safer results.</p>
<p>To produce the figures, I would first apply the electricity to the wood, often
at the corners. Initially the resistance of the wood is not sufficient to allow
any burning. Then I would use a spray bottle full of water/baking soda to
moisten the surface of the wood until the electricity could find the path of
least resistance and start the burning reaction. With the low-power neon
transformer the burning is slow and takes hours.</p>
<p>To guide the reaction in an &ldquo;aesthetically pleasing way&rdquo;, I used a heat gun to
temporarily dry out parts of the wood, creating channels of low-resistance
surface water. This technique is most evident on piece <a href="#10">#10</a>. It was also
used on <a href="#15">#15</a> to evenly cover the entire (large) piece.</p>
<p>After the electrical treatment, each piece was finished with varnish, matted,
framed, and shipped. Below is a gallery of final results. Each was given to a
friend or family member as a winter gift:</p>
